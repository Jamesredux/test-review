<div class="conversation">
  <p>There are advantages and disadvantages to having a weekend job. One advantage is that we can make money.</p>
  <p>Another benefit is that we can learn about work. A big disadvantage is that we have less free time to do the things we want with our friends</p>
  <p>Another problem is that we can get too tired. On balance, I think that it's good to have a weekend job.</p>
