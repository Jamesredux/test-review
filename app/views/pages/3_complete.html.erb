<h3><u>Part 3</u></h3>
<p>
There are dangers around us every day, Did you know that every year, about 100 Americans choke on their ballpoint pens? Well, it's true, Children can also choke on candy and toys. </p>

<p>To prevent choking in the home, keep small things like coins off the floor and out of reach of children</p>

<p>If you are choking, you can make the universal choking sign by putting your hands around your throat.</p>
<p>
If someone is choking, you should give them first aid. Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist. Give thrusts slightly above the belly button to force out the object that they are choking on.

</p>

	<h3><u>Part 4</u></h3>
	<p>
There are advantages and disadvantages to having a weekend job. One advantage is that we can make money.</p>


<p>Another benefit is that we can learn about work. A big disadvantage is that we have less free time to do the things we want with our friends</p>

<p>Another problem is that we can get too tired. On balance, I think that it's good to have a weekend job.
